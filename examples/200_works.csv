They have  seized control over the entire planet, including the Stargate. Humanity is at the brink of extinction. Human lifespan has almost tripled, but most of the human population is born infertile. Only a small percent of humans are so-called gifted ones, who are able to conceive/father children. Strict rules apply to these gifted ones, as the Aschen want to uphold the human population.</p><p>Sam Carter is 25 years old. She has just come of age and undergoes her first fertility tests. When her tests turn out positive, her life is about to take a dramatic turn for the worse. Unwilling to accept a forced marriage and life in a breeding facility under Aschen control, she runs away from home to find the resistance and fight for the freedom of Earth as well as her own.<br/>As she meets Jack O'Neill, camp leader of resistance Cell 4, neither of them realizes they are bound together by more than the mutual goal to free Earth from Aschen reign. Side by side, they fight to liberate their world using a second, secret Stargate found almost a century before in the Antarctica forests...</p>", "['Mature']", "[]", "['F/M']", "Stargate SG-1", "[]", "[]", "[]", "English", "2015-07-03", "290089", "51", "51", "5", "54", "23", "3257"
